            <p>WINTER IS HERE ü•∂ Right on queue with this heavy welly fog! Your Wellness Team are aiming to bring a bit of light into the office this winter, through different speakers, events, and treats until Spring starts springing!!</p>
            <p>‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ We‚Äôve kicked off with yummy T2 teas and soups in the cupboards with leftover bread from Wellness lunches in the freezers ready to toast to go with ‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ</p>
            <p>Reminder too of the support we have to tap into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Raise</strong> - We partner for EAP (Employee Assistance Programme) services with Raise. This is a great scheme which allows all of us to access confidential support from a professional counsellor, therapist, etc. Crucially, they also have a host of wellbeing and mental health resources available, incorporating maoritanga via the Te Whare Tapa Wh√† model. You can see a library of what‚Äôs available <a href="https://www.raisementalhealth.co.nz/for-employees.html">here</a>, and look at the Mental Health resources (split across 5 crucial tikanga - hinengaro, whanau, whenua, tenana, wairua) over here.</li>
                <li><strong>Spectrum Life</strong> - Spectrum Life is the U.K. equivalent of Raise, and while we understandably aren‚Äôt able to access their direct support resources, the portal still has a wealth of wellbeing (mental and physical) resources. To register for the very first time, use <a href="https://octopusenergy.spectrum.life/login?org=OctESL">this link</a>. To log in once you have registered, click <a href="https://octopusenergy.spectrum.life/login">here</a>. The Wellbeing tab here is stacked - Individual Insights via a custom survey and metrics, Fitness, Nutrition, Wellbeing, Calmness, Podcasts, the list is exhaustive!</li>
                <li><strong>Headspace</strong> - A really nifty little app (works on desktop too) that provides guided meditation and mindfulness in bite-sized pieces! Need help sleeping? Meditating? Controlling your breathing? Achieving focus? You‚Äôre covered. Use <a href="https://work.headspace.com/fieldheadspace/join?signup=489DTM">this link</a> to register an account using your Octopus email address. The app is mobile-based, but can also be accessed via a browser <a href="https://www.headspace.com/">here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Burnalong</strong> - Virtual classes, webinars, and other things you might expect from this fitness-based platform. You can join the groups, make your own fitness plan, and get a buddy to join in too!
